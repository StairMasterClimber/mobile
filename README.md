# Stair Climber Master, Fitness and Fun, for iPhones

What do fitness and fun have in common? You know… besides starting with the letter F?
Let me tell you. They both were used in creating our new app!

But how did we achieve such a feat? We turned a low impact cardio exercise (stair climbing) into a fun and competitive game! With our app you’re able to compete with friends, family and even strangers in a variety of different events and challenges.

When you open the app for the first time it will ask you about your activity level. After you answer the prompt you will be taken to the main page of the app.

Here we have our different tiles. You have Activities, Competition, and Achievements:
- Activity currently shows you your flights climbed in the past seven days in addition to your flight goals.
- The competitions page shows who you are currently competing with as well as an explanation on how to send a challenge.
- The achievements tile shows you achievements you’ve recently acquired and in the near future it will show you a completion percentage for unlocked challenges. It’s also where you send the aforementioned challenges. But words are cheap. You know what’s worth more? Trying the app for yourself, available exclusively on your iPhone!

The app gets your flights climbed using HealthKit securely from your iPhone. The Stair Stepper Machine feature calculates the number of stairs you climbed while using a stair stepper machine and adds it securely into your phone's HealthKit vault!
